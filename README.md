# Clustering



## K-means clustering
#### Advantages
- Relatively simple to implement.
- Scales to large data sets.
- Guarantees convergence.
- Can warm-start the positions of centroids.
- Easily adapts to new examples.
- Generalizes to clusters of different shapes and sizes, such as elliptical clusters.
#### Disadvantages
- Choosing  manually
- Being dependent on initial values.
- Centroids can be dragged by outliers, or outliers might get their own cluster instead of being ignored. Consider removing or clipping outliers before clustering.
